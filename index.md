**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**<br />
Our section has been researching on weakly supervised learning on task classification this quarter. We implemented non-training classifiers which untilized TF-IDF and Word2Vec on the seed words, compute scores on the seed words and pick the class with the highest score accordingly. 
This shattered my previous thoughts on machine learning because I thought models should experience the process of "training" no matter what.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br />
So far, I wanted to build an application employing one of the LLMs. I am currently researching on the new features released by OpenAI.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br />
I expect my quarter 2 project would be much unlike to the quarter 1 project. My quarter 2 project would be more like a software engineering project instead of a machine learning project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br />
Various input data (eg, images, pdf,etc) will be taken into consideration to build the quarter 2 project. APIs from not only LLMs, but also from other generative AI platform will be employed as well.
